# RanchApp



This app was made only for my beloved ranch members !

- Purpose of the app:
A private social media - where my school friends can share our memories using media sharing functionality and add descriptions to memory cards. 

- 8 pre registered users with unique profiles.
- Wheel-Scroll selector, where a member must select his specific avatar and provide a given password.
- 8 empty profiles -> where each user can edit his/her description: including pictures 
  (
    ability to take a picture and upload one using the phone gallery or camera. 
  )
- automatic pie chart - adjustable to the grades the members received in school. 
- Member screen - where each member can see the whole description about the other members.

All the data is stored using firebase storage.
All the users are registered using firebase auth / descriptions data is saved using firestore.
